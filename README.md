This Project was done as a part of Winter in Data Science(WiDS) , IIT Bombay, and was mentored by Gaurav Misra.

Camouflage Object Masking deals with the task of identifying and segmenting out objects that are
not well-distinguished from their backgrounds. This is a specialized problem within the domain of
Computer Vision, which has been seeing and continues to see rapid advances and novel techniques.

The Dataset given can be downloaded, and the paths in the code can be changed accordingly to run and test the model.
